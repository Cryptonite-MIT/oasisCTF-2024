# DESCRIPTION
The keys, as if possessed by some unseen force, and become one. They now begin to whisper. Their voice, a soft murmur, weaves a cryptic sequence of letters and numbers: 
J5AVGSKTPNWDA53LGN4V65BQGBPXGMDGORPXG4BQNMZW4XZTNB6Q==== 
The string seems nonsensical at first glance, but you sense a hidden message within. Your task is clear: decrypt the enigma whispered by the key.
