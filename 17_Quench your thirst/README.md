# DESCRIPTION

How could the IOI overlook such a critical flaw? You now possess administrative privileges! Surveying your surroundings, you notice the monitor displaying a series of commands accessible only to the admin. However, another security measure is in place—it’s encrypted, and only the true admin knows the key. Can you crack this encryption scheme?

# WRITEUP
Use the cipher identifier on boxentriq, you'll get some cipher and then enter it in and you'll get the decoded PT. The link is altered though. So you figure out that Y Q Z J are repeated only once and that you can get the katbin link only if you find an optimum combination for them.

## PLAIN TEXT

AS THE PROTAGONIST STUMBLED INTO THE HEART OF THE IOIS TRAP THE WALLS AROUND HIM FLICKERED WITH SCORCHING HEAT A MASSIVE IMPENETRABLE FIREWALL ROARED IN EVERY DIRECTION CUTTING OFF HIS ESCAPE THE IOI HAD ANTICIPATED HIS INFILTRATION AND THIS WAS THEIR FINAL GAMBIT TO STOP HIM BUT ARTEMIS HAD LEFT HIM WITH A GIFT A COMPUTER TERMINAL IN THE CENTER OF THE CHAMBER THE SCREEN BLINKED TO LIFE AWAITING INPUT WITH A FLASH OF INSPIRATION HE REALISED WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO ADMIN PRIVILEGES HAD BEEN UNLOCKED THE COMMANDS HE EGGSECUTED HERE COULD DISMANTLE THE FIREWALL AND ALLOW HIM TO REACH THE HEART OF THE VIRUS IF HE FOLLOWED THE CORRECT ORDER THE LIST OF ADMIN COMMANDS APPEARED ON THE SCREEN ADMIN COMMAND LIST FIREWALL BYPASS 
1 VERIFY THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE FIREWALL SCANNING FOR VULNERABILITIES IN THE DEFENSE SYSTEMS   
2 DISABLE THE FIREWALLS AUTOREPAIR MECHANISM WHICH REGENERATES ANY BREACHED SECTIONS   
3 DISPLAY ALL ACTIVE FIREWALL LAYERS THIS REVEALS THE NUMBER OF DEFENSIVE LAYERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIGURATIONS   
4 MANUALLY DISABLE THE THIRD FIREWALL LAYER WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE STRONGEST BARRIER PROTECTING THE CORE   
5 SCAN FOR MALICIOUS PATTERNS THAT MIGHT BE HIDDEN INSIDE THE FIREWALL CODE THIS HELPS NEUTRALISE ANY TRAPS LAID BY IOI     
6 ISOLATE THE SIGNATURE FILE USED BY IOI TO SUSTAIN THE FIREWALLS INTEGRITY   
7 OVERRIDE THE FIREWALLS ENCRYPTION WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL ADMIN PRIVILEGES BREAKING IOIS CONTROL OVER IT   
8 EGGSECUTE A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF ALL FIREWALL LAYERS LEAVING THE SYSTEM UNPROTECTED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT   
9 RESET THE ACCESS CONTROLS TO OASIS GATEWAYS ALLOWING UNRESTRICTED MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SERVERS THE TERMINAL BEEPED WITH EACH SUCCESSFUL COMMAND EGGSECUTION AND THE HEAT AROUND HIM BEGAN TO FADE WITH EVERY FIREWALL LAYER DEACTIVATED THE PATH FORWARD BECAME CLEARER HE WAS ALMOST THROUGH ONLY ONE FINAL COMMAND TO DISABLE THE LAST OF IOIS TRAPS AND HE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE VIRUS CONTROLS THE FATE OF THE OASIS WAS NOW IN HIS HANDS
