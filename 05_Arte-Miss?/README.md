# DESCRIPTION
As the darkness recedes, Halliday’s voice echoes with the chilling news that Innovative Online Industries (IOI) has seized control of the OASIS. A virus has infected the main server, sparking widespread panic as players lose their progress. Amidst the chaos, Artemis materializes before you, her avatar flickering erratically. With a sense of urgency, she thrusts a file into your hand and whispers something unintelligible before dissolving into a cascade of pixels.
Stunned and disoriented, you scrutinize the mysterious file, desperate to understand its significance. Just then, a calming voice cuts through the turmoil—it’s Artemis, speaking from the real world. She reveals that the file holds the key to liberating the OASIS from IOI’s grip. Though she was captured and her character deleted, she managed to pass this vital piece of information to you in a final act of defiance.


Now, Artemis will be available to give hints to solve challenges on your journey. Hints will be available only after a certain amount of time. Hints will also cost a certain number of points.(not sure)
