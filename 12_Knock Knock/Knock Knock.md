# DESCRIPTION

At last, the key darts towards the door, a keyhole materializes, and the door swings open.
Author’s Note: I don’t know about you, but I was definitely growing tired of this key.
You find yourself standing at the entrance of a labyrinth. The only way out is to navigate through the labyrinth itself. However, the entrance is guarded by an image recognition system. A QR code is pasted on the wall beside it. Your task is clear: bypass the system to gain entry.


# WRITEUP

Given is an obscured QR code. The player has to unobscure it using increased contrast, etc. to get the flag from the QR.
