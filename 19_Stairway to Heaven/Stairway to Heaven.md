# DESCRIPTION
The ground beneath you trembles as Tetris blocks rain from the shadows, cascading down like a storm. At first, panic sets in, but then you realize: these blocks aren’t meant to crush you—they’re your escape. Each piece, carefully arranged, could form a staircase to the control room floating above in the void. It’s time to use them strategically and rise to safety. Stack the blocks and find your way out!
