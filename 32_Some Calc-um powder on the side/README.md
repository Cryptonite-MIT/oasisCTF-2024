# DESCRIPTION

After bypassing the Black Wall, you find yourself in front of the IOI’s core data server. There seems to be some data which you have access to right away, but it does not seem to be very important and relevant to save the game. It looks like the perfect trap, however at this point you don’t have any choice so you go all in.


# WRITEUP
