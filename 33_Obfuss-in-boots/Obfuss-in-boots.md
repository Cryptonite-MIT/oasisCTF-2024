# DESCRIPTION
In the server, you find a very glitchy entity, however everything is too blurry for you to see because of the infected entity. You try and navigate your way through the murkiness but keep getting lost. Your head is swimming and you feel the tiredness ebb through your brain. Push yourself through and get into the core of the system in order to save the OASIS universe.


# WRITEUP
- Given file is a `.docm` document, we extract its macros.
- In the macros, a variable `f` keeps being appended to by integers from `flag_array`.
- Simply add `MsgBox f` to the end of macro and run it to get the flag.
