# DESCRIPTION

Victory comes not from playing the game, but from outwitting it. Yet, even as you break free, you realize the virus has hidden itself deep within the OASIS database. Thousands—maybe millions—of data fragments fill the screen. Somewhere among them, the virus lies dormant, waiting to strike again. It’s time to sift through the noise and identify the hidden threat. Using the basics of machine learning, perform exploratory data analysis to try and figure out a pattern. Can you find the virus among the data?

# WRITEUP

This is a CSV file on which exploratory data analysis is to be performed using pandas to find a pattern which will help the user find the flag.
