# DESCRIPTION
Success! You now hold the reins to the mechanoid army. With the press of a button, you command them to cease their attack. But why stop there? These machines can be more than just neutralizedâ€”they can be repurposed. You send new orders, converting them into your allies. The mechanoids turn on their former masters, fighting by your side. The battlefield is yours to command.
