# DESCRIPTION

I have been falling for 30 minutes!
It hits you! The IOI uses an encrypted communication service to control the virusâ€™s every move. Your mission is clear: sever the link between the IOI and the virus to isolate and defeat it. However, you linger too long in one place, and the IOI catches wind of your plan. The ground trembles and splits open, sending you plummeting into the abyss.
You land with a resounding THUD, surrounded by towering firewalls. You see a computer in the middle of the cell, and feel like you can use it to your advantage. But before you can make a move, you notice a PACMAN guarding the computer. He looks hungry and angry. Can you feed him and break free from this digital prison?
